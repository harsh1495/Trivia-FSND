# Full Stack API Final Project

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.

[View the README.md within ./frontend for more details.](./frontend/README.md)
